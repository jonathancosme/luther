# Code Review: Project 2

## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Great job using python functions and a py file to webscrape. This same process can be used for your preprocessing and modeling steps. 


## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md
- Markdown cell at beginning each section of the .ipynb explains scope and analyis. Loved it.
- Inline code comments were used properly. 
- Very clear and concise
- Be careful naming variables. E.g. "y_model". You can simply use y_train as the input of the model. 

## Proper Data Sciencegy 
- Great job using advanced modeling techniques (AR & Neural Networks)
- In addition to using advanced modeling,I would have liked to see your methodology of improving thos models.
- Good visualizations -- not too much info, clear and interpretable. Love the busiest stations highlighted in orange on gray, very effective way to highlight relevant info.

## Comments:

- Great job on project 2! :)
- Enjoyed the comparison model approach/project design
- Looking forward to seeing more advanced neural networks :)
